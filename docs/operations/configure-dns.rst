Configure DNS
-------------

For local one-node Vagrant clusters, we've created the DNS record ``local.deisapp.com`` which resolves to the IP of the first VM, 172.17.8.100.
You can use ``local.deisapp.com`` to both log into the controller and to access applications that you've deployed (they will be subdomains of ``local.deisapp.com``, like ``happy-unicorn.local.deisapp.com``). So, no further DNS configuration is necessary.

For a non-local one-node cluster, we schedule and launch one router, and deis-router and deis-controller will run on the same host. So, both DNS records can be configured to point to this one machine.

On a multi-node cluster, however, there are probably multiple routers, and the controller will likely be scheduled on a separate machine. As mentioned in :ref:`configure-load-balancers`, a load balancer is recommended in this scenario.

Note that the controller will eventually live behind the routers so that all external traffic will flow through the load balancer - configuring a DNS record which points to a service whose IP could change is less than ideal.

Necessary DNS records
-------------

The DNS records for Deis should be configured as such:
* ``deis.example.org`` should resolve to the IP of the machine that runs ``deis-controller``
* ``*.deis.example.org`` (a wildcard DNS entry) should point to the load balancer (or the same machine for 1-node Vagrant, or any single instance of ``deis-router`` if one likes to live life on the edge)

These records are necessary for all deployments of Deis (EC2, Rackspace, multi-node Vagrant) except for a local, one-node Vagrant setup, which can use ``local.deisapp.com``.
