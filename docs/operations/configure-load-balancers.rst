Configure load balancers
-------------

For a one-node Deis cluster, there is one router and one controller, so load balancing is unnecessary. You can proceed with the next section: :ref:`configure-dns`.

On a multi-node cluster, however, there are probably multiple routers scheduled to the cluster, and these can potentially move hosts. Therefore, it is recommended that you configure a load balancer to operate in front of the Deis cluster to serve application traffic. A simple configuration is one that has all Deis machines listed in its configuration file, but a host is only considered 'healthy' when it is serving traffic on port 80. This enables the load balancer to serve trafic to whichever hosts happen to be running the deis-router component at any one time.

The load balancer is also the suggested SSL termination point, as SSL is not currently supported between Deis components.

Further documentation around load balancers is planned for Deis 1.0.
